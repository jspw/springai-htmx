# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core data models for conversation memory
  - Create ConversationMessage class with role, content, timestamp, and metadata fields
  - Create ConversationMemory class to hold session ID, message list, context metadata, and last activity
  - Add proper constructors, getters, setters, and utility methods for message management
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Implement ConversationMemoryStore for session-based storage
  - Create ConversationMemoryStore component that uses HTTP session attributes for storage
  - Implement methods to store, retrieve, and remove conversation data from sessions
  - Add session lifecycle management and automatic cleanup capabilities
  - Write unit tests for all storage operations and edge cases
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Create ContextBuilder for intelligent prompt construction
  - Implement ContextBuilder component that formats conversation history into contextual prompts
  - Add logic to extract context metadata from messages (user skills, topics, preferences)
  - Create methods to build prompts that help LLM understand references and context
  - Write unit tests for prompt building with various conversation scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Develop ConversationService as the main orchestration layer
  - Create ConversationService that coordinates between memory store and context builder
  - Implement methods to add user and assistant messages to conversation history
  - Add buildContextualPrompt method that combines current message with relevant history
  - Create conversation management methods (get, clear, cleanup)
  - Write comprehensive unit tests for all service operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Integrate conversation memory into ChatController
  - Modify ChatController to extract session ID from HTTP requests
  - Add ConversationService dependency and integrate it into message handling flow
  - Update handleChatMessage to store user messages before processing
  - Modify LLM prompt building to use contextual prompts instead of raw messages
  - Update streaming response handling to store assistant messages after completion
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Implement context resolution and reference handling
  - Enhance ContextBuilder to identify and resolve pronouns and references in user messages
  - Add logic to match references like "that", "it", "this" to previous conversation elements
  - Implement fallback behavior when references cannot be resolved clearly
  - Create unit tests for various reference resolution scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 7. Add memory management and performance optimizations
  - Implement configurable limits on conversation history length per session
  - Add intelligent context truncation when conversations become too long
  - Create automatic cleanup of expired conversations and session management
  - Implement error handling for memory overflow and storage failures
  - Write tests for memory limits, cleanup, and error scenarios
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Create integration tests for end-to-end conversation memory
  - Write integration tests that simulate multi-turn conversations with context
  - Test that references and pronouns are properly resolved across message exchanges
  - Verify that conversation history persists correctly across multiple requests
  - Test streaming functionality continues to work with conversation memory enabled
  - Create tests for session expiration and memory cleanup scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 9. Add configuration and monitoring capabilities
  - Create configuration properties for conversation memory settings (history limits, cleanup intervals)
  - Add logging for conversation memory operations and performance metrics
  - Implement health checks and monitoring for memory usage and session counts
  - Create configuration validation and error handling for invalid settings
  - Write tests for configuration loading and validation
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 10. Enhance error handling and graceful degradation
  - Implement comprehensive error handling for all conversation memory operations
  - Add graceful fallback to non-contextual responses when memory operations fail
  - Create proper error logging without exposing sensitive conversation data
  - Implement recovery strategies for various failure scenarios
  - Write tests for error conditions and recovery behavior
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
