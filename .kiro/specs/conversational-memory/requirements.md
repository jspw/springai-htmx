# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the LLM chat application to maintain conversational context and memory across multiple interactions within a chat session. Users should be able to reference previous statements, questions, or topics without having to repeat context, creating a more natural and efficient conversational experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LLM to remember what I've told it earlier in our conversation, so that I can reference previous topics without repeating myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a statement about themselves (e.g., "I am not good at python") THEN the system SHALL store this context information for the current chat session
2. WHEN a user later asks a follow-up question related to previous context (e.g., "How can I improve that?") THEN the system SHALL understand the reference and provide relevant responses
3. WHEN a user references "that", "it", or other pronouns THEN the system SHALL resolve these references using conversation history
4. WHEN a conversation spans multiple exchanges THEN the system SHALL maintain context across all interactions in the session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand implicit references in my questions, so that I don't have to be overly explicit in every message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks "How can I improve that?" after discussing a skill or topic THEN the system SHALL identify what "that" refers to from conversation history
2. WHEN a user uses pronouns like "it", "this", "these" THEN the system SHALL resolve them to appropriate entities from previous messages
3. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions without full context THEN the system SHALL infer the missing context from conversation history
4. IF the system cannot resolve a reference THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification rather than making incorrect assumptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history to be maintained throughout my chat session, so that the context builds naturally over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends multiple messages in a session THEN the system SHALL accumulate and maintain all conversation history
2. WHEN the system generates responses THEN it SHALL have access to the complete conversation history for context
3. WHEN a user references something from early in the conversation THEN the system SHALL be able to access and use that information
4. WHEN a conversation becomes very long THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently while preserving important context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide contextually relevant responses based on our conversation history, so that each response feels personalized and informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL consider relevant conversation history to provide contextually appropriate answers
2. WHEN a user asks for help with something they previously mentioned struggling with THEN the system SHALL tailor advice to their specific situation
3. WHEN providing examples or suggestions THEN the system SHALL consider the user's previously stated preferences, skill level, or context
4. WHEN the conversation topic shifts THEN the system SHALL maintain awareness of both current and previous topics for potential connections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the conversation memory to be efficiently managed, so that the system performs well even with long conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversation history grows large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL not experience significant performance degradation due to conversation history size
3. WHEN memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate memory management strategies
4. WHEN a chat session ends THEN the system SHALL properly clean up conversation memory resources
